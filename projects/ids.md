## Dissertation
My dissertation was focused on forecasting solar energy.
I developed a machine learning model in TensorFlow that used satellite weather imagers to forecast irradiance.
We compared this method do a number of ML models that used ground based weather data.

#### Abstract:
> Adoption of renewable energy sources is a key step in curbing the effects climate change.
> Moving away from traditional energy generation processes presents many challenges.
> Unlike coal and natural gas many renewable energy sources and specifically solar operate intermittently and have abrupt changes in output.
> This variability presents a problem both for the generators, trying to meet contractual obligations, but also the grid operators endeavouring to ensure a consistent load.
> Having a system capable of producing accurate predictions of solar irradiance would be of use to both parties.
> This project aims to build such a system.
> Leveraging advancements in both the domains of machine learning and big data processing.
