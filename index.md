## The Basics

Hi, I'm Tim. 
I am currently working on my [Ph.D.](/projects/phd) in the School of Computer Science @ the University of Nottingham.
I have always been interested in computers and technology. 
Personally I blame my dad for letting me play on his computer when I was young.
My passion has lead me to have some fantastic opportunities and meet some truly remarkable people. 
I love writing clean code, solving interesting problems and taking pictures. 
I find myself most productive with a fresh cup of coffee and some _sick tunes_.
In my spare time, I'm an occasional climber and amateur photographer, you can check out some of my favourite shots on my [Gallery](gallery).

<!-- I have also realised that my website is woefully out of date and needs a big update (Sept 2023) so that's something to add to the list. -->

## What I'm up to

Most likely lost in a tensor

Working on my [Ph.D](/projects/phd)! (I know, who would have guessed it). Playing with lots and lots of satellite images, RNNs, CNNs, and Spark!

Check out my [projects](projects) page to see more of what I'm up to.
