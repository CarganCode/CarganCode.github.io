﻿So im new to Jekyll and so far I’m loving it, I already use it for two of my sites (this and TeenTech's website). My only complaint is that I couldn't find a good Markdown editor. I'm Dyslexic and my spelling is atrocious, when i'm writing lots of text I want to use an editor with good spell check and all the other niceties. The trouble is most text editors, such as Sublime or Textwrangler, are use primarily for coding. As such they have no or a very limited spell check. My first thought was to use MS Word as a text editor but it turns out that editing Markdown files in Word doesn't work all that well. It was when I was playing around with some autoCrat stuff that it hit me. I could use Google docs!


Google docs would be perfect, they have a solid spell check and all the other stuff you want from a text editor and as an added bonuses everything is saved in the cloud. Now I know what you're thinking. “Thats great Tim but how are you going to get the docs into a post?” But that’s the best part!
