As many of you know (since I have one reader its everyone), I have been maintaining autoCrat on behalf of New Visions for the last year or so. Sadly I am announcing that its time to step down. It has been a fantastic experience and I have learned a ton working with the Cloud Lab team.

>I wanted to announce that I will be taking over for Tim Cargan as lead developer on autoCrat. Tim has done an incredible job transitioning autoCrat from the old script framework into the new add-ons framework and has taught the Cloudlab team a lot along the way.

>But alas, he needs to focus on applying to colleges and finishing high school (that's right, he is a high school senior). Tim has been gracious enough to offer continued support, albeit in a much reduced capacity.

I think Jared has put it perfectly, I donâ€™t have the time needed to work on a full scale app and do everything else I need to get done. I will still be working on autoCrat in a reduced capacity for the foreseeable future and I have some other exciting projects in the work but for now I will be stepping back.
