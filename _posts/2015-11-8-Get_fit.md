I have been at University for about 6 weeks now. In that time I have come to realise it is very easy to be unhealthy. I happen to be in catered accommodation so I don't have to worry about food, at least that's what I thought, but it seems like nutrition isn't something uni catering cares about. The only thing I seem to be eating is carbs, all day, every day. On top of that all of the snacks I can easily get are unhealthy (the vending machine only has sweets and soft drinks).

As such I have started going to the gym. It's much easier to stay fit, then get healthy. That's not to say it can't be done. My dad did it, but he had to follow the mantra:
  

>You've got to be prepared to be hungry
  

Something I'm not. If I watch what I eat and exercise, I should be able to stay relatively fit and not have to be too hungry.
