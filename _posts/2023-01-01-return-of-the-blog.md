It's a new year! So I should probably make some resolutions.

Currently all my writing is either academic or email / teams messages.
I want to write more.
Essays and long form have always been something I have struggled with (yes I too question why I would do a Ph.D.). 
I think it is in part because of to my dyslexia. 
I can be a bit self-conscious about spelling issues etc.
It's also hard work.
But like exercises Iâ€™m sure if you regularly use the muscles it gets easier (at least I want to believe that).
So, I think it's time to bring back the blog!

My goal should hopefully be fairly easy: 
- 8 total posts (this one counts so only 7 to go)
- 4 long reads, any post that is long enough to need sections. They can be about anything, research projects, PhD life, work. 
- I also would like to add some short posts, they could just be code snippets or a quick idea / observation.

Wish me luck.
