This was once the auto generated post, or as Jekyll says `post`, yeah thats right, inline code BAM! 

Ok so now you are like WOW inline code thats cool. But wait theres more:

{% highlight javascript linnos %}
//We can have block code
/* 
With syntax highlighting!
*/

function test(var someting){
	var this = document.getelementbyid("test");
	for (var i = 0; i < someting; i ++){
		doSometingAwesome("yes thats right!") 
	}
	return "It did everything and more"
}

{% endhighlight %}

It had said stuff like:

>You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
>To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

I know, nothing that fun (and yes thats wright, blog quotes)


Well I'm off to work on the homepage coz yeah, it needs to be done... Well i should plug what I'm using for the site:
