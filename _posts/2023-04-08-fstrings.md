There are a few ways to do string interpolation in python:

```python  
value = "abc"

# All output `"value=abc"`

"value={0}".format(value)
"value={name}".format(name=value)
f"{value=}" 

# you can do multi line with
s = ("this is split up "
    "over multiple lines "
    f"and has {value=} in"
)

# Dealing with numbers
seconds = 0.00001
f"{seconds:.3}
```

 the format is `<digits before the .>.<digits after the .><type>`
