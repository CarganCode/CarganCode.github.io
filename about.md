##What makes me, me

I am a Computer Science student @ the University of Nottingham, technically Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence but thatâ€™s a bit of a mouthful. I'm also an amateur photographer, you can check out some of my favorite shots on my [Gallery][gallery]. I enjoy building websites and working on cool projects.

**_Thats cool but what have you done?_**<br>

Well I made this site. I also maintain [autoCrat][autoCrat] a Google sheets add-on. I'm in the process of organizing [TeenTech NY][ttny] a global tech conference, for teens by teens (I also built that site).
