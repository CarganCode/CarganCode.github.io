## What makes me, me?

I am a Computer Science student @ the University of Nottingham, technically Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence but that’s a bit of a mouthful.
I'm also an amateur photographer, you can check out some of my favourite shots on my [Gallery][gallery].
I enjoy building websites and working on cool [Projects][projects].
Feel free to check out my full [CV](/docs/cv.pdf).

## The long version

I’m international, I have lived all over the place. I’m one of those people that when you ask where they are from let out a sigh and ask if you’re sure you want to know. I was born in Brighton, England but have spent time living in Singapore and most recently New York, USA (if you couldn’t tell from the photos).

I have always had an interest in computers and how they work. I started programing when I was 14 (in visual basic). My foray into coding happened to line up with my move to Singapore where I met some teachers who really supported me and enabled me to foster a real passion and interest in the subject. It was due to the skills I developed and the people I met in Singapore than when I moved to New York I was introduced to Andrew Stillman.


I love travling and have been fortunate enough to visit many places all over the world. I have also had the opertunitly to meet some truly remarkable people.
