<h2 style="font-family: serif;font-weight: lighter;">The Basics </h2>

<p>I have always been interested in computers and technology as a whole. Personally I blame my dad for letting me play on his computer when I was younger. My passion has lead me to have some fantastic opportunities and meet some truly remarkable people. I love writing clean code, solving interesting problems and taking pictures. I find myself most productive with a fresh cup of coffee and some <i>sick tunes</i>.</p>
