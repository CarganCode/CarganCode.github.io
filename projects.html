	<a href="/projects/phd"><h3 class="project_title"> Ph.D. <normal style="color:gray"> | 2019 - Present </normal></h3></a>
	<hr>
	After finishing my Undergrad, I was offered a Ph.D.!
	 My PhD is titled “Real World Solar Energy Power Prediction and Use Optimisation,” and focuses on developing and applying novel forecasting, planning and optimisation techniques for use with renewable energy.
	 I build on the work done in my dissertation with an aim to improve and expand it. 
	 I want to improve our forecasting methods and investigate optimisation methods for energy storage (e.g Batteries)

	<a href="https://github.com/TimCargan/chemise"><h3>Chemise <normal style="color:gray">| 2022 - Present </normal> </h3> </a>
	<hr>
	It started out with a plan to be a lightweight wrapper around <a href="https://github.com/google/flax">Flax</a>, a deep Learning library built for <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">JAX</a>, to take care of all the boiler plate.
	Over time it has evolved into a Keras like library that I use to train all the models in my PhD over the last 18 months.
	It can do a lot of fancy things thanks to the power of JAX;
	Model and Data parallelism; automaticity working on multiple GPUs; logging of metrics; checkpoints and much more.
	It supports loading data from tf-datasets (and im working on adding support for basic in memory datasets).

	<a href="https://github.com/TimCargan/eumetsat-downloader"><h3>EUMETSAT Downloader <normal style="color:gray">| 2020 - Present </normal> </h3> </a>
	<hr>
	A tool to download satellite imagery from <a href="https://www.eumetsat.int">EUMETSAT</a>, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (now that's a mouthful).
	The library is designed to download the and process the high res, high frequency, images produced by the <a href="https://navigator.eumetsat.int/product/EO:EUM:DAT:MSG:HRSEVIRI">high rate SEVIRI</a> from the MSG satellites.
	After downloading and loading the files into pngs, they can be loaded into a number of formats for various uses.

	<a href="https://github.com/TimCargan/alethia"> <h3> Aleitha <normal style="color:gray">| 2020 - 2021 </normal> </h3> </a>
	Another ML tracking library. I know, there are loads of them out there.
	I decided to build my own as none of the ones out there exactly fit my workflow, and since I only use it for my Ph.D. work, I can make it as bespoke as I want.
	It also is a fantastic way to play with some new tech / ideas and get better at writing code. 
	I stopped working on this in summer 2022 and moved over to MLflow as it does almost everything I need.

	<a href="/projects/ids"><h3 class="project_title"> Dissertation <normal style="color:gray"> | 2018 - 2019 </normal></h3></a>
	My dissertation, aka individual project. The goal of the project was to develop methods for forecasting solar energy.
	I developed a machine learning model in TensorFlow that used satellite weather imagers to forecast irradiance.

	A Google Sheets Add-on used by over 80,000 people worldwide as a document merge utility for Google Drive. Originally build by Andrew Stillman for New Visions for public schools, the charity where volunteer, the Add-on version was rebuild from the ground up and is maintained by me.
