	Another ML tracking library. I know, there are loads of them out there.
	I decided to build my own as none of the ones out there exactly fit my workflow, and since I only use it for my Ph.D. work, I can make it as bespoke as I want.
	It also is a fantastic way to play with some new tech / ideas and get better at writing code.

A highschool hackathon organised by HackMIT and Piolet, held a googles offices in cambriege (The one where MIT is!). The team I was part of worked on a multiplayer astroid style game.
