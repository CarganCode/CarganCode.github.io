		After a successful dissertation, I was offered a Ph.D.! We will build on the work done in the dissertation we hope to improve and expand it. We want to improve our forecasting methods and investigate optimisation methods for energy storage (e.g Batteries)

	Another ML tracking library. I know, there are loads of them out there.
	I decided to build my own as none of the ones out there exactly fit my workflow, and since I only use it for my Ph.D. work, I can make it as bespoke as I want.
	It also is a fantastic way to play with some new tech / ideas and get better at writing code.

	My dissertation, aka individual project. The goal of the project was to develop methods for forecasting solar energy.
	I developed a machine learning model in TensorFlow that used satellite weather imagers to forecast irradiance.
